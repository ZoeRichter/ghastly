        '''
        Initializes the Sim class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        r_pebble : float
            Radius of the pebbles in the simulation [m].
        t_final : float
            Total reactor-time that is being simulated [s].
        pf : float
            Target packing fraction in core region.  Determines total number
            of pebbles, but packing fraction may not match this value in
            all areas due to settling.
        core_intake : dict
            Dictionary containing key:value pairs where each key is the name
            of a core element within the core intake zone, and the value is a
            dictionary with key:value pairs corresponding to a core element
            parameter and its value.
        core_main : dict
            As core_intake, but for the main zone of the core.
        core_outtake : dict
            As core_intake, but for the outtake zone of the core.
        k_rate : float
            Contraction rate, to be used with OpenMC's pack_spheres function.
            Default is 0.001.
        down_flow : bool
            The direction of flow in the reactor core.  True means it is
            flowing downward, False means it is flowing upward.  Default is
            down, i.e., True.
        seed : int
            Seed used in LAMMPS simulations whenever a seed is required.
            Default is a random integer 6 to 7 digits long.
